Parallel's goal is to build the social and technical infrastructure needed for accurate predictions on decision relevant questions in the science and technology space.

This started as a relatively simple project to list AI technology questions on prediction markets. However, we quickly realized how many pieces were missing from the forecasting "ecosystem" that we would need in order to draw useful insight from  markets.

Outstanding Issues:

- Operationalization: How do you generate good forecastable questions that are tied to real world events and still contain a strong 'signal' of what is going to happen? How can you decompose a big question into well 'operationalized' smaller questions?
- Mechanism Design: What's the right structure to reward forecasters for their time and contributions, while promoting the sharing of insights? How can you leverage market mechanisms and ensure regulatory compliance?
- Scaling: Getting 10 people to share their ideas and models on a forecast is relatively easy - how do you get 1000 people?

----

Our strategy is to build out this missing infrastructure and use it to forecast on AI technology issues. We expect this to look like a combination of software and organizations - real and fake money prediction markets and tournaments (ai.metaculus), new software to organize and display the aggregated forecasts, and codified knowledge (dictionary, resolution council).
